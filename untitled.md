Computational power is at the point where we do not, in point of fact, understand how our algorithms work, or how they arrived at particular conclusions [ref]. Or even worse, we dimly perceive enough to tell a ‘just-so’ story to make sense of what we *think* is going on. In this article, we describe a project that takes a step back from ‘big data gothic’ (that is, the tendency to revel, to sublimate ones’ self, in the majesty of the digital infoscape) to model some of archaeology’s biggest data: the networks of trade and social control that underpinned the Roman economy. We describe an ‘analog simulation’ that requires the computational power of four humans: a board game. The value of creating a board game ….
