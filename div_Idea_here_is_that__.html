<div>Idea here is that both are simulation, but because no AI referee, no black box, ‘players’ in an analog simulation - who would be the agents in a computational simulation - can see what the rules do to the simulation/play, and can contest, improve, alter, drop, or add rules as necessary. A board game admits the possibility of not submitting to the algorithm. This it strikes me is something that needs to be reinforced in digital work. Simulations should be stupid enough - clear enough - that one could work through them in pen and paper.<br></div>
